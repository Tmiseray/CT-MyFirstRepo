Exercise 2: Developing an API for Managing a Virtual Bookstore

Problem Statement: 
You have been tasked with creating a RESTful API for a virtual bookstore. This API will interact with a MySQL database to manage authors and books. The bookstore needs endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on authors and books.

Instructions:
1. Implement Flask routes to add authors and books.
2. Create routes to retrieve all books along with their authors' details.
3. Ensure all routes handle potential errors and return appropriate responses.

Hints:
- Utilize the Python scripts developed in previos exercises ('add_records.py*, retrieve_data.py', 'update_book.py*,delete_book.py*) to guide your Flask route implementations.
- Remember to establish and close database connections properly in each route.
- Use HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.
- For retrieving books, consider joining the 'Books' and 'Authors' tables to provide comprehensive book information.
