Exercise 2: Fetching and Displaying
Poetry Data Using PoetryDB

Problem Statement:
You're developing a feature for an educational app that displays a list of poems by a specific author, including the title and lines of each poem. Your task is to use the Poetry API to fetch poems by a given author and display their titles and excerpts.

Instructions:
1. Set up a Python environment and install the requests package.
2. Write a Python script to send a GET request to the PoetryD API to fetch poems by a specific author.
3. Extract the title and the first few lines of each poem from the API response.
4. Print each poem's title followed by the extracted lines.

Hints:
- PoetryDB's endpoint for fetching poems by an author: https://poetrydb.org/author/{author_name}.
- Use requests. get (url) to make the GET request.
- The response from the API will be in JSON format, which can be converted to a Python object using response. json ().
- Use a loop to iterate through the list of poems in the response.
