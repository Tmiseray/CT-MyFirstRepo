# 1. Create Multi-Line String & Print
MyPassion = '''I am passionate about art! I have been a
tattoo artist for a few years now. My favorite parts about
tattooing include:
1. Letting my creativity flow! Most people come to me with
an idea of what they may want, but may not have an image.
I take their ideas and build a few designs for them to
choose from!
2. Bringing an idea to life! Once my clients select a
design, we start on sessions. Each tattoo is different and
may take shorter or longer time to complete depending on
detail, size, style, colors, and personal sitting
tolerance. But once I do finish the tattoo, the expressions
I see to my art fills my heart and soul with joy! Some
clients even cry tears of joy! Nothing beats that
feeling!!'''

# 2. Simple Calculation
# First I define variables a and b
a = 6
b = 7

# Then I print the solution for adding a and b
print("The sum of a and b is:", (a+b), "!")
