    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the e-commerce industry, managing a diverse range of products can be challenging, especially when dealing with large inventories. Duplicate entries and unorganized categories can lead to inefficiencies. Your task is to create a Python script that processes a list of product-category pairs, eliminates any duplicates, and categorizes the products neatly.\n",
