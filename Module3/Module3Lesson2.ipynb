    "Your task is to develop a system for an online store's product catalog. This system should enable the addition of new products, display the entire catalog, and allow for searching for products by category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a function to add products to the catalog. Each product should be represented as a tuple containing the product's name, price, and category.\n",
    "2. Create a function to display all products in the catalog.\n",
    "3. Develop a search functionality for users to find products by their category.\n",
    "4. Store all product tuples in a list.\n",
    "5. Use exception handling to manage errors, especially for invalid inputs.\n",
    "6. Implement a text-based user interface using a loop and conditional statements, allowing users to add products, view the catalog, search by category, or exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilize a while loop to keep the program running, presenting a menu of actions until the user decides to exit.\n",
    "- Use the input() function for gathering user inputs for adding products.\n",
    "- Implement a for loop for iterating over the product tuples in the catalog display.\n",
    "- For searching by category, iterate over the catalog and use an if statement to filter products.\n",

The conference has multiple sessions, each represented as a tuple containing the session's title and speaker.
