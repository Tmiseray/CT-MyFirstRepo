# Exercise 1: E-Commerce Product Data Extraction

"""
Objective:
To develop a Python script that efficiently extracts and organizes product information from a text data source, replicating a common task in e-commerce data management.

Problem Statement:
In an e-commerce setting, you are faced with a large text file containing detailed product information. The challenge is to parse this semi-structured data to extract relevant details such as product IDs, names, categories, and prices, and then store this information for easy access and analysis.

Instructions:
1. Read a string that contains product information (simulating data from a file).
2. Implement a regex pattern to identify and extract the necessary product details.
3. Store and organize the extracted data into a structured format, like a list of dictionaries.
4. Incorporate error handling for potential data parsing issues.
5. Display the organized data in a readable format for end-users.

Hints:
- Utilize re.findall() for pattern-based data extraction.
- Craft a regex pattern tailored to the specific data format of the product details.
- Use dictionaries for storing individual product data, and a list to hold all products.
- Implement loops to process and store each extracted product.
- Apply try-except blocks to gracefully handle any parsing errors.
