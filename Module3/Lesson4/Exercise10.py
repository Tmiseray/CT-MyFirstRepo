# Exercise 10: Formatting Log Files for Analysis
"""
Objective:
Develop a Python script to reformat entries in a log file for easier analysis, using the re.sub() function to standardize date formats and anonymize sensitive information.

Problem Statement:
You have a log file from a web server that contains various entries with timestamps and user emails. The timestamps are in different formats, and you need to standardize them. Additionally, for privacy concerns, you need to anonymize user email addresses in the log.

Instructions:
1. Read a string that represents log file entries.
2. Use re.sub() to standardize timestamp formats (e.g., convert "14/03/2022" to "2022-03-14")
3. Use re.sub() to replace email addresses with a placeholder text like "[ANONYMIZED]"
4. Handle any exceptions that might occur during the process.
5. Display the reformatted log entries.

Hints:
- Develop regex patterns to identify different timestamp formats and email addresses.
- Use re.sub() to replace identified patterns with standardized formats or placeholder text.
- Employ try-except blocks to manage any anomalies in the log entries.
