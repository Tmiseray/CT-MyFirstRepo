# Exercise 8: Personal Finance Tracker
"""
Objective: Develop a Python program to track and analyze personal finances, focusing on categorizing expenses and income. This exercise will cover file handling for maintaining financial records, integrating Python concepts such as functions, input handling, string manipulation, and try-except blocks, along with data structures like lists and dictionaries.

Problem Statement: Create a Python program to help manage personal finances by tracking expenses and income. The financial data will be stored in a file (finance_records.txt), with each line containing a date, type (expense/income), category, and amount, separated by commas (e.g., "2023-03-21, Expense, Food, 15.00"). The program should provide insights such as total expenses, total income, and spending by category.
