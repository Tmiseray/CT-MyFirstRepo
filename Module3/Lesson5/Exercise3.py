# Exercise 3: Weather Data Analysis
"""
Objective: To create a Python program that analyzes historical weather data. This exercise will involve processing and interpreting data from a weather log file, integrating Python concepts such as file handling, string manipulation, functions, conditional and loop statements, and using data structures like lists and dictionaries.

Problem Statement: You are tasked to develop a Python program that processes weather data stored in a file (weather_data.txt). Each line in the file contains a date, temperature (in Celsius), and rainfall (in mm), separated by commas (e.g., "2023-03-15, 16,5"). The program should analyze this data to provide insights such as the average temperature, days with rainfall above a certain threshold, and temperature trends.
