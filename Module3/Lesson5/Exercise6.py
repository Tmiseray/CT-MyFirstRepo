# Exercise 6: Recipe Collection Manager
"""
Objective: To create a Python program for managing a personal collection of recipes. This exercise will focus on file handling for reading and organizing recipe information, integrating Python concepts like functions, input handling, string manipulation, and try-except blocks, along with data structures such as lists, sets, and dictionaries.

Problem Statement: Your task is to develop a Python program that organizes a collection of recipes stored in a file (recipes_collection.txt). Each line in the file should contain a recipe's name, followed by its ingredients and preparation steps, separated by semicolons (e.g.,
"Chocolate Cake;flour, sugar, cocoa powder;mix, bake"). The program should allow users to add new recipes, search for recipes by ingredient, and list all recipes.
