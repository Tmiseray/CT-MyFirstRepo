# Exercise 2: Library Book Management System
"""
Objective: Develop a Python program to manage a small library's book inventory. This program will involve file handling for storing book information and integrate Python concepts such as functions, input, string manipulation, and try-except blocks, along with data structures like lists and dictionaries.

Problem Statement: Your task is to create a Python program for a library to manage its book inventory. The inventory is stored in a file (library_books.txt), with each line containing a book's title, author, and the number of copies, separated by commas (e.g., "Python Basics, John Doe, 5"). The program should allow adding new books, updating existing book details, displaying all books, and checking the availability of a specific book.
