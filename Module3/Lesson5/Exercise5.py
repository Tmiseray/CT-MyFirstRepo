# Exercise 5: Event Attendance Tracker
"""
Objective: Develop a Python program to track and manage attendance for various events.
The program will involve file handling for storing and retrieving attendance data and integrate Python concepts such as functions, input handling, string manipulation, and try-except blocks, along with data structures like lists and dictionaries.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a Python program to manage attendance records for a series of local events. The attendance data will be stored in a file (event_attendance.txt), with each line containing an event's name, date, and a comma-separated list of attendee names (e.g., "Python Workshop,2023-03-21,John Doe, Jane Smith"). The program should allow for adding new events, registering attendees, and generating attendance reports.
