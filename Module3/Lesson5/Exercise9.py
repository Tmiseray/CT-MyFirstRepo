# Exercise 9: Unique Travel Destinations Analyzer
"""
Objective: Create a Python program to analyze and report unique travel destinations from a collection of traveler experiences. This exercise will use file handling for processing travel data and incorporate Python concepts such as tuples, sets, functions, string manipulation, and try-except blocks.

Problem Statement: Develop a Python program that helps identify unique travel destinations mentioned in a collection of traveler experiences. The experiences are stored in a file (travel_experiences.txt), with each line containing a traveler's name and a comma-separated list of destinations they've visited (e.g., "John Doe: Paris, London, New York").
The program should extract and list all unique destinations across all travelers.
