# Exercise 10: Multilingual Phrasebook Compiler
"""
Objective: Design a Python program to compile a multilingual phrasebook from various language text files, focusing on handling encoding and decoding with UTF-8. This exercise will involve file handling for processing text in different languages and incorporate Python concepts like functions, string manipulation, and try-except blocks.

Problem Statement: Create a Python program that consolidates common phrases in different languages into a single phrasebook. Each language will have its phrases stored in a separate file (e.g., phrases_english.txt, phrases_spanish.txt, phrases_french.txt), with each line containing a common phrase. The program should combine these phrases into a single file (multilingual_phrasebook.txt), ensuring proper handling of various character encodings.
