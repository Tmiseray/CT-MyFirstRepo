# Exercise 7: Daily Task Scheduler
"""
Objective: Create a Python program to manage and schedule daily tasks, integrating file handling for storing task data. This exercise will cover Python concepts such as functions, input handling, string manipulation, conditional and loop statements, and data structures like lists and dictionaries, along with date and time manipulation.

Problem Statement: Develop a Python program to help users organize their daily tasks.
The tasks will be stored in a file (daily_tasks.txt), with each line containing a task description, due date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), and status (e.g., "Finish Python assignment,2023-03-25,Pending"). The program should allow users to mark tasks as completed, view overdue tasks, and display tasks for a specific date.
