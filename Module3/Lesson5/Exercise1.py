# Exercise 1: E-commerce Product Inventory Management
"""
Objective: To develop a Python program that manages a simple e-commerce platform's product inventory. This program will handle various file operations, including reading, writing, and updating inventory data. It will also integrate key Python concepts such as conditional and loop statements, functions, string manipulation, and exception handling, along with the use of lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a Python program for managing an e-commerce store's inventory. The inventory data is stored in a text file (inventory.txt), with each line containing a product's name, quantity, and price, separated by commas (e.g., "T-shirt,30, 19.99"). The program should allow adding new products, updating existing product details, displaying all products, and checking stock for a specific product.
