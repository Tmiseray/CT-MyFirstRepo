# Exercise 4: Customer Feedback Analysis System
"""
Objective: Develop a Python program to analyze and categorize customer feedback from a file. This exercise involves file handling for reading customer comments, integrating Python concepts like string manipulation, functions, conditional statements, loops, and data structures such as lists and dictionaries for categorizing feedback.

Problem Statement: You need to create a Python program to process customer feedback stored in a file (customer_feedback.txt). Each line in the file contains a customer's name and their comment, separated by a colon (e.g., "John Doe: Loved the product, excellent quality!"). The program should categorize these comments into positive, negative, and neutral feedback based on certain keywords and provide a summary.
