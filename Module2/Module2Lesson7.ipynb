    "# Exercise 10: Robust Calculator Input Handling\n",

    "# Objective: To practice handling different types of exceptions in user input, specifically focusing on ValueError and TypeError, and ensuring the program concludes gracefully using a finally block\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement: You are developing a calculator app that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The app should robustly handle user input, ensuring that only numerical values are accepted and operations are performed correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions:\n",
    "# 1. Ask the user to enter 2 numbers\n",
    "# 2. Ask the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)\n",
    "# 3. Perform the operation and display the result\n",
    "# 4. Use a try/except block to handle ValueError and TypeError exceptions\n",
    "# 5. No matter what happens, thank the user for using the calculator in a finally block\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints:\n",
    "# - Use float() to convert the input strings to numbers\n",
    "# - Use an if/elif/else structure to perform the chosen operation\n",
    "# - In the except blocks, handle ValueError for non-numeric input and TypeError for incorrect operations (like division by zero)\n",
    "# - Use the finally block to print a thank-you message"
