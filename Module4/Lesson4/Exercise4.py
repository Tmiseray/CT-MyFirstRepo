Exercise 4. Developing a Movie Theater Seat Reservation System

Objective:
Create a Python application to manage seat reservations in a movie theater,
emphasizing clean coding practices, particularly in the use of clear and descriptive variable and function names.
This exercise will also incorporate OOP, conditional and loop statements, string manipulation, error handling, and Python data structures.

Problem Statement:
You are tasked with developing a seat reservation system for a movie theater.
The system should allow users to view the seating arrangement, select seats, and confirm their reservations. 
The focus is on creating a user-friendly interface and backend logic using clear, descriptive naming conventions for variables and functions.

Instructions:
1. Design a class to represent the theater, including attributes for the seating arrangement.
2. Implement methods for displaying the seating chart, selecting seats, and confirming
reservations.
3. Create a user interface using input functions to interact with the theater system.
4. Use appropriate data structures to manage the seating arrangement (consider lists or dictionaries)
5. Implement error handling for user inputs, such as selecting already reserved seats or invalid seat numbers.
6. Organize your code into modules to separate the user interface from the backend logic.
7. Ensure all variables and functions have descriptive and clear names for easy understanding and maintenance.
