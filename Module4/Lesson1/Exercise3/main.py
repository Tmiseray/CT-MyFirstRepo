Exercise 3: Recipe Ingredient Converter - Instructions

1. Create a Conversion Module:
    - Create a Python module (unit_converter. py) with functions for different unit conversions, such as cups to milliliters, teaspoons to milliliters, etc.
2. Implement Conversion Functions:
    - In unit_converter.py, write specific functions like:
        - cups_to_milliliters(cups): Converts cups to milliliters. 
        - teaspoons_to_milliliters(teaspoons): Converts teaspoons to milliliters.
    - Assume 1 cup = 237 milliliters and 1 teaspoon = 4.93 milliliters.
3. User Interaction in Main Script:
    - In the main script (main. py), use the input function to ask the user for the ingredient quantity and the unit they want to convert from.
    - Import and use the specific functions from the unit_converter module based on the user's choice.
4. Error Handling:
    - Include try-except blocks in main. py to handle invalid inputs like non-numeric values.
5. Test the Converter:
    - Run the program to test various conversions, ensuring each function in the module works as expected.
