Exercise 1: Building a Contact Management System - Instructions

1. Create a Module:
    - Start by creating a Python module (contact_manager. py) that will contain all the functions for the contact management system.
2. Design Functions:
    - Implement the followina functions in vour module:
        - add_contact(contacts, name, phone, email): Adds a new contact to the contacts list.
        - view_contacts(contacts): vDisplays all the contacts
        - search_contacts(contacts, name): Searches for a contact by name.
        - delete_contact(contacts, name): Deletes a contact by name.
3. Implement Data Structures:
    - Use a list to store all contacts. Each contact should be a dictionary with keys name, phone, and email.
4. User Interface:
    - In your main Python file (main. py), create a user interface using the input function that allows users to choose an action (add, view, search, delete contacts).
5. Error Handling:
    - Include try-except blocks to handle errors, such as searching for a non-existent contact or entering invalid data.
6. Test Your System:
    - Add at least 5 contacts, search for a couple of them, delete one, and view the updated contact list to ensure your system is working correctly.
