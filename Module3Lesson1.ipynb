    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a dictionary to represent the product catalog.\n",
    "2. Implement functions for:\n",
    "    - Adding a new product category.\n",
    "    - Adding a product to an existing category.\n",
    "    - Displaying all categories and their respective products.\n",
    "    - Searching for a product across all categories (case-insensitive).\n",
    "3. Use exception handling to address potential errors, such as adding products to non-existent categories.\n",
    "4. Implement case-insensitive search functionality for product queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with a pre-populated dicitonary for ease of testing.\n",
    "- Utilize string methods like 'lower()' for case-insensitive comparisons.\n",
    "- In the search function, iterate through all categories to find the product.\n",
