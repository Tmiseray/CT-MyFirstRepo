Some helpful hints: 

Modular Design: Break down your application into logical modules.

Reusability: By using modules, you can easily reuse code. 

Maintainability: With modular code, making changes or updates becomes simpler and less risky.

Testing: Testing modules independently becomes more straightforward. You can write and run tests for each module to ensure its functionality before integrating it into the main system.

Importing Modules: Use the import statement to include modules in your main application script. 

Directory Structure: Organize your modules in a clear directory structure.

Naming Conventions: Follow Python naming conventions for your modules. Typically, module names should be lowercase with underscores to improve readability (e.g., smart_device.py).

Documenting Modules: Provide documentation for each module. A brief comment at the beginning of each module explaining its purpose and functionality can be very helpful.

By adhering to a modular approach, your solutions for the assignments will not only be more effective and efficient but also align with industry standards. This practice will prepare you for larger-scale projects in your programming career.
